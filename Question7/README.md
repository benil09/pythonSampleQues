Explanation:

	•sort_list() function: This function takes a list of strings as input and sorts it using the sort() method. The key parameter of the sort() method uses a lambda function (lambda x: len(x)) that sorts the strings based on their length.

	•lambda x: len(x): This lambda function calculates the length of each string in the list and uses it to sort the strings in increasing order of their length.


This will sort the strings from the shortest to the longest based on their length.
