Steps:

	1.	Create a NumPy array: The user provides a start number and an end number. The array should contain numbers from start to 2 * end, incremented by 2.

	2.	Form a square matrix: This array is reshaped into a square matrix.

	3.	Create Arrays A1 and A2: From the matrix, two arrays, A1 and A2, are created:
     	•	A1 contains elements divisible by a non-zero number n.
	    •	A2 contains elements not divisible by n.

	4.	Create Diagonal Matrices: Arrays A1 and A2 are used to construct two matrices (A11 and A22), where the elements from A1 and A2 will be placed along the diagonals, and the rest of the elements will be set to zero.



Explanation:

	1.	Array Creation: The np.arange(start, 2 * end + 1, 2) generates an array from the start value to 2 * end, with a step of 2.


	2.	Reshape Array: The array is reshaped into a square matrix. The number of elements should be a perfect square. If the total length is not a perfect square, extra elements are discarded.


	3.	Divisibility Filtering:
	•	A1 contains elements that are divisible by n.
	•	A2 contains elements that are not divisible by n.


	4.	Diagonal Matrices: Two matrices, A11 and A22, are created with the elements from A1 and A2 placed on the diagonal, and the rest of the elements set to zero. The create_diagonal_matrix function handles this task.



Notes:

	•The code handles the reshaping of the array to a square matrix by adjusting the array length to fit the square.

	•The create_diagonal_matrix function places the elements of A1 and A2 along the diagonal of their respective matrices.

	•The user is prompted for n, which determines how the elements of the array are split between A1 (divisible by n) and A2 (not divisible by n).
