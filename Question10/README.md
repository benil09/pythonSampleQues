Explanation:

	1.	Creating Lists for Student Data:
	  •	student_names: A list comprehension creates names like Student1, Student2, …, Student10.
	  •	roll_numbers: A list comprehension generates roll numbers from 101 to 110.
	  •	mid_sem_marks: A list comprehension generates random marks for the mid-semester exam, between 40 and 100.

	2.	my_zip() Function:
	  •	This function checks if all input lists are of the same length (homogeneous) before combining them into a list of tuples using zip(). If the lists are not homogeneous, it raises a ValueError.

	3.	my_sort() Function:
	  •	This function sorts the list of tuples based on a specified index (either Name, Roll No, or Mid Sem Marks) and the specified sorting order (ascending or descending). The sorting is done using Python’s built-in sorted() function with a lambda function for custom sorting.

	4.	DataFrame Creation:
	  •	A Pandas DataFrame is created from the list of tuples (student_data) with columns Name, Roll No, and Mid Sem Marks.
	  •	Two additional columns, Assignment Marks and End Sem Marks, are added with random values between 40 and 100.
	  •	The total marks are calculated by adding the Mid Sem Marks, End Sem Marks, and Assignment Marks, and a new column Total Marks is added to the DataFrame.

	5.	Saving the Data to CSV:
	  •	The DataFrame is saved as a CSV file named student_data.csv using the to_csv() method.




	2.	Sorted List:
	  •	A sorted version of the list by mid-sem marks, in descending order.

	3.	DataFrame:

	  •	A table displaying student details with columns:
	  •	Name, Roll No, Mid Sem Marks, Assignment Marks, End Sem Marks, Total Marks.
	4.	CSV File:
	  •	A CSV file student_data.csv containing the same information as in the DataFrame.
