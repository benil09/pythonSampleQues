Here’s a Python script that performs the tasks as specified:
	1.	The script takes a start and end value from the user.

	2.	It creates a NumPy array from start to 2 * end, incremented by 2.

	3.	It creates a square matrix M from this array.

	4.	It uses conditional logic to create two new arrays A1 (elements divisible by a non-zero number n) and A2 (elements not divisible by n).

	5.	It creates diagonal matrices A11 and A22 where the elements from A1 and A2 are placed along the diagonals, and the other elements are set to zero.


Explanation:

	1.	Array Creation:

	  •	The np.arange(start, 2 * end + 1, 2) function generates an array starting from the start number, up to 2 * end (inclusive), with a step of 2.
	2.	Square Matrix:

	  •	The arr.reshape(square_size, square_size) reshapes the array into a square matrix. The square_size is calculated based on the square root of the length of the array.
	3.	Divisibility Filtering:

	  •	The code creates two arrays:
	  •	A1 contains the elements of the array that are divisible by n.
	  •	A2 contains the elements of the array that are not divisible by n.
	4.	Diagonal Matrices:

	  •	The function create_diagonal_matrix is used to create two square matrices A11 and A22 where the elements from A1 and A2 are placed along the diagonal, and the rest are set to zero.
      
Key Points:

	•	The input values are used to create a range of numbers which are then reshaped into a square matrix.

	•	The divisibility logic separates the elements into two arrays based on whether they are divisible by the number n provided by the user.
    
	•	The diagonal matrices A11 and A22 are created by placing the elements of A1 and A2 on the diagonals, with other elements being set to zero.
